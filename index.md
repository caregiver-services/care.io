### Companionship Care

Everyone needs a friend, whether it is for accompanying them to the mall or the doctors’ offices, we have you covered. We do our very best to match our clients with a caregiver that they feel the most comfortable with. We offer services such as providing a caregiver that speaks the same language as the client, or one who can cook their favourite meals. Making sure our clients feel at peace in their own home is our responsibility and we are determined to make that happen.


### Personal Care

We want to ensure that clients are at ease within his or her own home and has their personal needs met. This means that they can live independently without suffering through the difficulty of not having their personal needs met. Our caregivers are trained in all aspects of care such as laundry, light housekeeping, planning and preparing meals, bathing, medication reminders etc.
